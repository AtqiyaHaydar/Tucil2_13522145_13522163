## General Information
This project is a web application designed to create Bezier curves using two different algorithms: divide and conquer, and brute force. Bezier curves are widely used in computer graphics and animation to create smooth and natural-looking curves. The purpose of this project is to provide a platform for users to visualize and compare the results of these two algorithms in generating Bezier curves.

The project aims to address the need for a tool that can efficiently demonstrate the differences between the divide and conquer algorithm and the brute force algorithm in creating Bezier curves. By allowing users to input the number of points and observe the resulting curves, they can gain insights into the efficiency and accuracy of each algorithm.

The motivation behind undertaking this project is to deepen understanding of algorithmic strategies, particularly in the context of computational geometry and graphics. Additionally, creating a practical application for visualizing algorithmic concepts helps solidify learning and can serve as a valuable educational resource.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/AtqiyaHaydar/Tucil2_13522145_13522163.git`

2. Change directory to src
`cd ./src/`

3. Install node package manager (this includes installing all dependencies)
`npm install`

4. Run the project
`npm run dev`

5. Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser


## Usage
Once the project is set up and running locally, users can access the web application through their browser. They can input the desired number of points and choose between the divide and conquer algorithm or the brute force algorithm to generate the corresponding Bezier curve. The application will then display the generated curve for visualization and comparison.



## Project Status
The project is complete and fully functional.


## Room for Improvement
While the project is functional, there are areas where improvements can be made:

- **Performance Optimization:** The program should be optimized to process iterations more quickly, especially for a large number of points.
- **Frontend Optimization:** Enhancements can be made to improve the rendering speed of graphics on the frontend, ensuring a smoother user experience.


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the study of algorithmic strategies and computational geometry.
- The implementation of the divide and conquer and brute force algorithms was based on theoretical concepts and research in the field.
